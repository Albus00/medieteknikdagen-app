### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note!

This is a simplified setup guide. Some packages may be outdated and you might need to:

- Update dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`
- Adjust code to match the latest versions of Flutter or packages
- Add Firebase configuration if you want full app functionality (see previous documentation)

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to edit the code and see the results directly on your device.

Good luck!
